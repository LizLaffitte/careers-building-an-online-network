# Finding and Connecting with People Online

Not everyone has a current and thriving network of first and second-degree connections. If you’re newer in your career, you may not have one at all. And that’s okay. 

A lot can come out of identifying and reaching out to people online—even if you've never connected with them before. The lesson below covers how to find these people and how to engage with them.

## How to Find the Right People to Connect With 

First, you need to find the right people to connect with. You can’t just connect with anyone. You want to be strategic about it and identify individuals who work at companies you’d like to work for, or who hold job titles you’d like to have. (Or, aspire to one day have.)

One strategy is using interesting job postings you find online as “leads.” Then, find developers who work at these companies.

You can also use LinkedIn to find people who work at companies you’d like to work for and/or individuals who have your “dream” position. Like being a lead developer at a gaming company.

Here are some other places where you can research people to connect with online:

* Social media (LinkedIn, Twitter)
* Their blogs
* Online communities/forums (LinkedIn groups, StackOverflow, Reddit)
* GitHub

To keep track of your research, create a spreadsheet. Use your job tracking spreadsheet you created in Unit 1 and keep this outreach in a separate tab if that’s helpful for you.

## How to Find an Email Address

Great, you compiled a shortlist of people you’d love to meet. Next, you need to find the best way to reach them. In almost all cases, your first outreach to a person will be via email. Unlike sending out a tweet or LinkedIn message, which can easily go unnoticed, in an email you’ll be right in a recipient’s inbox, and more likely to be seen. 

Here are some of the most common ways to find an email address. 

1. **Website/blog** - If they have one, look on their “Contact” or “About” page. 
2. **LinkedIn profile** - Many people will include their email address in their contact or summary section on LinkedIn. (Also, in the “advice for contacting” section usually found at the bottom.)  
3. **Github profile** - Many people will list their email address on their Github profile

If the approaches above prove fruitless, there are a few other things you can try:

1. [Rapportive](https://rapportive.com/) - a Chrome extension that adds LinkedIn profile info in your Gmail inbox. You can test out different emails, and see if a LinkedIn account appears for it. If it does, you guessed their email correctly.  

2. [Mailtester.com](http://mailtester.com/) - checks whether an email address is attached to a specific domain 

3. [Snapbird](http://snapbird.org/) - allows you to search Twitter to see if a person ever shared their email address in a Tweet 

4. [Connectifier](https://www.connectifier.com/) - a web browser plug-in that pops up whenever a user views a profile on a social site like LinkedIn or GitHub to provide additional information like email addresses and phone numbers. 

It’s pretty easy to figure out a company’s email convention (e.g. firstname@company.com). If you can figure out the email address of one employee at a company you can likely do some detective work and figure out the email address of a person you’re trying to contact if you know his or her full name.

## How to Engage with Them 

Once you find an email address for a contact, it’s time to reach out. 

Remember, building a professional network is a long-term strategy. The idea is to build relationships over time. So, before even sending a message, make sure to research them. What they do, where they work, if they have a blog (or not), and anything else you can find. 

When you’re ready to send an email, here’s a few things to keep in mind so you come across as helpful, not a nuisance. 

**Send a customized email.** It's *really* obvious when an email message is a boilerplate template, copied and pasted to many people. Send a personal message!

**Explain why.** After briefly introducing yourself, share why you’re reaching out to them.

**Find a commonality.** If possible, find some kind of mutual connection (“I also know Sally!”), interest (“I’m a Vegan, too.”), location (“In fact, I went to college in Boston! I loved it there.”), etc.  

**Show interest.** In them, their job, their blog, company, industry, etc. Be specific about what it is you’re interested in. If you like a person’s blog, cite a specific post they wrote and why it resonated with you.

**Provide value.** Even if it’s as simple as complimenting their website’s design. You could also include an article you’d think they’d like (say, if you know they are vegan, a recent article that talks about all the benefits of being a vegan). 

**Make your ask specific and not too big.** Your initial email should have some kind of “call to action” or ask. Essentially, an action you’d like them to take. However, make sure it is something small enough that they could do in a few minutes or less. If your ask is too big, the person will probably save the email for later. And then there’s a great chance they’ll never get back to it. So, you want to make the ask simple enough that they can respond right away. 

**Be respectful of them/their time.** Remember: you’re approaching them. They are going out of their way to help you. So, be respectful of their time. If they say they can only do a 15-minute phone call, don’t press for a 30-minute one. 

**Don’t forget to thank them.** Thinking into the future once you’ve established contact and had a coffee meeting, don’t forget to follow up with a thank you. In future lessons we address the specifics of these. Additionally, should this new contact actually be responsible for introducing you to your next job, you need to go out of your way to thank that person. Even consider sending them a small gift (like a plant or a bottle of wine) as a token of your appreciation. 

## It's All About Relationship Building

You don’t need to be face-to-face to form strong professional relationships —you can take part in relationship-building online. What matters is **how** you approach them. In the end, be clear, concise, and respectful of them and their time. Just like meeting in real-life, first impressions are also formed digitally.
